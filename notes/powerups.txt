Powerups:

Official Powerups:
- Lightning Storm
	Lighting bolts randomly removes single blocks from the field.
- Lighting Bolt
	A single bolt of lightning takes out an entire column of blocks.
- Bomb
	Removes a radius of blocks, possibly leaving some blocks fractured.
- Upside-Down
	Rotates the view around for 20 seconds.
- EMP
	Emits static discharges through the game's display, blocking out the Next Block and some static for three blocks.
- Ghost
	Fades the current block to a barely-distinguishable transparent white. (maybe 50% alpha)
- Bronze Block
	Doubles your scores for the next 30 seconds. Stacks on other score multipliers.
- Silver Block
	Triples your scores for the next 30 seconds. Stacks on other score multipliers.
- Gold Block
	Quadruples your scores for the next 30 seconds. Stacks on other score multipliers.

Basic Block Types:
- Normal
	Acts like classic Tetris blocks.
- Soft/Jelly
	Each piece slides down on landing to fit the surface. If a space opens up below, it will continue to slide down.
- Brittle/Cracked
	Can be crushed by at least four blocks landing on top of it, causing them to fall down.
	Can be "brushed" off the falling piece by pushing it past a landed block.
- Sticky
	Causes any blocks nearby to get stuck on it, removing them from their current location.
	(ie, pieces get removed from the falling block if they touch any unused side of the block, and vice versa)

Suggested Powerups:
- Hollow
	a) Either prevents a row from being removed until being removed by bombs or lightning,
	b) Or grabs any piece that tries to occupy the same space.

Powerups are triggered:
- By rows getting removed or blocks getting exploded by Lightning or Bombs.
	In both cases, the 'bit' is at rest in the grid already, so integer coordinates will
	work fine.
