An events system might be a good idea, it could simplify many problems that I'm having.

Examples of events I could use:
- Block-land:
	When a block lands on the grid
	Could be used to get a new block
- Row-full
	When a row is full and should start vanishing
	Could be used to trigger the vanishing animations as well as updating the score
- Row-removed:
	When a row has been removed
	Could be used to trigger the blocks above to fall
- Key-event:
	When a key is pressed or released
	Could be used to trigger block-motion events.
