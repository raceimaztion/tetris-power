An events system might be a good idea, it could simplify many problems that I'm having.

Examples of events I could use:
- Block-land:
	Triggered:	When a block lands on the grid.
	Parameters:
		- Shape:	The ID of the block-shape that just landed.
		- Land-X:	The x-coordinate of the leftmost column of the block.
		- Land-Y:	The y-coordinate of the topmost row of the block.
	Uses:
		- Could be used to get a new block.
		- Can trigger Row-Full events.
- Row-full
	Triggered:	When a row is full and should start vanishing.
	Parameters:
		- Row-Num:	The index of the row that is now starting to disappear.
	Uses:
		- Could be used to trigger the vanishing animations as well as updating the score.
- Row-removed:
	Triggered:	When a row has finished vanishing.
	Parameters:
		- Row-Num:	The index of the row that is now gone.
	Uses:
		- Could be used to trigger the blocks above to fall.
- Key-down:
	Triggered:	When a key is pressed.
	Parameters:
		- Key-ID:	The ID of the key that was just pressed.
	Uses:
		- Could be used to trigger block-motion events.
- Key-up:
	Triggered:	When a key is released.
	Parameters:
		- Key-ID:	The ID of the key that was just released.
	Uses:
		- Could be used to trigger block-motion events.
- Block-motion:
	Triggered:	When the block moves.
	Parameters:
		- deltaX:	The offset in the horizontal direction.
		- deltaY:	The offset in the vertical direction.
		- newX: 	The new position of the leftmost column.
		- newY: 	The new position of the topmost row.
	Uses:
		- Could update the rendering system's knowledge of the grid's status.
