  A "screen" system would provide a simple mechanism to show different
information at different times without needing more global states than
actually needed.

  Screens are arranged in a "stack" and the screens above overlay on
the ones below. Some screens which don't need to draw the whole screen
can let the screen below draw itself first (and so on until we reach
the end or one that draws the entire screen), but only the topmost
layer recieves timer ticks and keyboard and mouse events.
